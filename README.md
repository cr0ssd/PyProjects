# PyProjects       

In this repository you can find projects that I started making during my first 6 months into the B. S. in Computer Science at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. Some projects include solution to both LeetCode and HackerRank questions and exames, as well as some challenges.

All of this projects are coded in Python, in the following months I will keep an update and throughout I progress in C++ and other languages, I will be gradually adding more repositories in other languages.
